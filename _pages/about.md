#### About

I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in pharmaceutical science at University of Southern California under the supervision of **[Prof. Jennica Zaro](https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/jennica-zaro-phd/)**., I am passionate about developing novel and effective drug delivery systems and optimization of drug formulation. I have a strong background in both research and regulatory affairs, holding two master degrees in regulatory science and biochemistry and molecular medicine. I'm familiar with FDA regulation, NDA and 510K submission from my experience in multiple internship programs.

Currently in Prof. Zaro's lab, I explore the pH-sensitive properties of antimicrobial peptides and their potential applications in treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Prior to this, I worked on antibiotic resistance and infectious disease research in Dr. Brad Spellberg's lab, where I conducted various assays, experiments, and data analysis on capsule formation, gene editing, and drug tolerance of hepatitis B virus.
